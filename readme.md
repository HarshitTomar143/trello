# 🧪 Local Development Setup

## 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-folder>

cd backend
npm install

Create .env inside backend/:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_db
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
PORT=5000


Run migrations:
npx prisma migrate dev

Start backend:
npm run dev

Frontend Setup
cd ../frontend
npm install


Create .env.local inside frontend/:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000

Start frontend:
npm run dev

# 🔎 API Testing with Postman

All REST APIs were tested using **Postman** to validate:

- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected route access
- Board, list, and task CRUD operations
- Task reordering and assignment endpoints
- Proper status codes and JSON responses

Authentication was verified by attaching the JWT token in:

Authorization → Bearer Token

This ensured all protected routes were securely validated before execution.
